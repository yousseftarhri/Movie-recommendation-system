# Movie-recommendation-system

## Overview:
This Python script implements a basic movie recommendation system using the concept of content-based filtering. Content-based filtering recommends items based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user's preferences. In this case, the content of movies (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director) is used to recommend similar movies.
